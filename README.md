# Academic-Private-Work

I have private repositories for all of my computer science coursework as well as for the templating based executable I created during my time with Social Standards. If you are a prospective employer and would like to access any of these private repositories or Github Gists please reach out to me at dbl2127@columbia.edu and I will respond promptly with links.

## Courses Taken 

### COMS 1004 -- Introduction To Computer Science/Programming in Java
**Professor: Adam Cannon**  
**Semester: Spring 2020**

COMS 1004 is Columbia's CS-1 course. The course objectives are to gain an understanging of:

*Fundamental Java programming skills  
*Knowledge of the fundamental concepts in computer science.  
*Algorithmic problem-solving capabilities.  

The course works its way up from translating trivial calculations into Java to building a few command line games (without GUIs) such as Nim and a modified version of video poker. By the end I walked away with a better understanding of how to integrate the Java API into my projects, organize and format my code, and solve problems iteratively.  

*Below is a high level-overview of the 1004 Programming Projects and my raw grades on each project. In additiona to the five Programming Projects their are five Problem Sets for which I also have repositories. Due to the fact that the problem sets have several very small pieces, I have not enumerated them below. To access any individual repositories that include the content and the class statistics please reach out to me at dbl2127@columbia.edu*  

1. 
  * Calculate the number of hours for a given period of time.
  * Calculate the date of Easter for a given year.
  * Binary leap year detector.
  * *Grade 58/60*
  
 2. Checksum functionality for an inputted credit number based off of a set of      specified criteria.
   * *Grade 44/50*
   
 3. The game of Nim: Nim has the player and computer each select marbles from a pile. The goal is to make your oponent take the final marble. 
  * For more on Nim check out [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) Wikipedia article
  * Two Way Postal Zip Code to Letter bar code translator. 
  *I have included an image from the Cay Horstman Big Java Early Objects 6e book to provide some context below.

  * *Grade 58/60*
  
4. Video Poker: The player starts with 5 tokens and is allowed to bet up to 5 tokens in order to multiply their winnings *n* times. The player is dealt five cards. They are allowed to reject up to all five of the cards. They are then dealt cards to replace their rejected cards and the hand is then scored.

  * *Grade 56/60* 
  
5. Talk Scheduler: The scheduler takes a list of possible "talks" In Name: Start - End format and outputs the maximum number of talks possible to schedule as a subset of the original list.
  * *Grade 63/70*

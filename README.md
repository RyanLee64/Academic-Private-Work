# Academic-Private-Work

I have private repositories for all of my computer science coursework as well as for the templating based executable I created during my time with Social Standards. If you are a prospective employer and would like to access any of these private repositories or Github Gists please reach out to me at dbl2127@columbia.edu and I will respond promptly with links.
